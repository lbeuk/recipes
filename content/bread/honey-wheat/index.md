title: "Honey Wheat Bread"
recipe:
    - Autolyse Mix:
        Ingredients:
            - Hard white spring wheat flour, whole grain:
                Amount: 1100g
            - Water:
                Amount: 800g
        Instructions:
            - Mix flour and water with hand until combined.
            - Let sit for one hour.
        Time:
            - Active: 5m
            - Inactive: 1h
    - Yeast Sponge:
        Ingredients:
            - Warm water:
                Amount: 100g
            - Active dry yeast:
                Amount: 2T
        Instructions:
            - Mix yeast into water until disolved.
            - Wait 10 minutes until yeast sponges. If the yeast does not look active by the end of 10 minutes, it is probably dead.
        Time:
            - Active: 2m
            - Inactive: 10m
    - Honey Wheat Bread:
        Primary: Yes
        Ingredients:
            - Autolyse mix:
                CREF: Autolyse Mix
                Amount: All
            - Yeast sponge:
                CREF: Yeast Sponge
                Amount: All
            - Kosher salt:
                Amount: 1T
            - Honey:
                Amount: 1/2C
            - EV olive oil:
                Amount: 1/2C
                Note: Any vegetable oil should suffice, I like to use EVO.
            - Hard white spring wheat flour, whole grain:
                Amount: 300g
                Note: For dusting the surface, anticipate most of this being absorbed into the dough.
        Instructions:
            - >
                Mix oil and honey together in the measuring cup, I find that this helps loosen
                up the honey so that less of it sticks to the walls of the cup.
            - >
                Combine all ingredients (except the dusting flour) by forming your
                hand into a flat hook shape and mixing. Mix until dough is firm enough
                to knead on counter.
            - >
                Cover an area on your work surface well with some of the dusting flour.
                Don't use it all immediately, more will be put down as the dough ball
                picks up and incorperated the flour.
            - >
                Knead the dough ball using a stretch and fold method for roughly 10
                minutes. The ending dough ball should be able to be stretched thin,
                although not quite forming a window pane as per the nature of whole wheat
                flour. Continue to cover the ball in flour as it starts sticking to your hands.
            - >
                Oil the outside of the dough ball and place in a covered bowl to rise
                for an hour, or until dough has roughly doubled in volume.
            - >
                Punch the dough ball down, and split and shape portions for the desired shape
                (makes ~3 loaves). For loaves, shape by stretching the dough under itself and
                tucking in the bottom center.
            - >
                In the meantime, start preheating the oven to 350 degrees F.
            - >
                Place the pans in the oven, bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the tops
                are lightly golden and sound hollow when tapped.
        Time:
            - Active: 20m
            - Inactive: 2h

This is the sandwhich loaf I was raised on, and is the primary recipe I continue to
use for day-to-day bread consumption. The bread comes out tender and light, slightly
sweet from the honey, and without the bitter taste that often comes from whole whea
bread thanks to using hard white wheat, rather than hard red wheat (which is often
the base for commercial bread flours).

The recipe usually yields enough dough for 3 loaves of roughly 3lb 10oz (loaf size
will vary depending on the pan you use to bake in), plus a little extra that I will
use to make snack-sized buns in a muffin pan. This recipe also works well for baking
buns - just shape the dough into buns on a sheet pan (air bake pans will help prevent
the bottoms from burning).

I use freshly ground prarie gold (hard white spring wheat) berries for my flour. I
found I could get 2lb bags from Natural Grocers for $1/lb, which is the cheapest
I've been able to find them. My mom used to get wheat in special orders from UNFI,
but I was unable to find Prarie Gold in our regional UNFI catalogue.

Before mixing all of the components, I mix together the flour and water to form an
autolyse, which aids in the formation of gluten and softening the bran in the flour.
This results in slightly reduced kneading times. The autolyse can be let to sit for
one to three hours, the longer the better.

After a few runs where the bottom of my loaf clung to the bottom of the loaf pan,
despite my best effort to thuroughly oil the pan, I switched over to using just
enough parchment paper to cover the bottom of the pan, while still oiling the sides
(you can use a knife or spatula to free the sides if necessary).
