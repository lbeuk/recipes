    - Sourdough Bread:
        Primary: Yes
        Ingredients:
            - Autolyse mix:
                CREF: Ferment Mix
                Amount: All
            - Kosher salt:
                Amount: 1T
            - Honey:
                Amount: 1/4C
            - EV olive oil:
                Amount: 1/4C
                Note: Any vegetable oil should suffice, I like to use EVO.
        Instructions:
            - >
                Mix oil and honey together in the measuring cup, I find that this helps loosen up the honey so that less of it sticks to the walls of the cup.
            - >
                Add the oil, honey, and salt to the mixing bowl containing the autolyse mix. Combine by kneading. This will take a few minutes until the the extra liquid is fully kneaded into the dough.
            - >
                Oil the outside of the dough ball and place in a covered bowl to rise
                for a another 2-3 hours, or until the dough roughly douples in size or
                springs back slowly when you press your finger into it for 2 seconds.
            - >
                Punch the dough ball down, and split and shape portions for the desired shape (makes ~3 loaves).
            - >
                In the meantime, start preheating the oven to 400 degrees F.
            - >
                Place the pans in the oven, bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the tops
                are lightly golden and sound hollow when tapped.
