                Amount: All
        Instructions:

                Knead the dough ball in the mixing bowl for roughly 10
                minutes. The ending dough ball should be able to be stretched thin,
                although not quite forming a window pane as per the nature of whole wheat
                flour.
            - >
                Oil the outside of the dough ball and place in a covered bowl to rise
                for an hour, or until dough has roughly doubled in volume.
            - >
                Punch the dough ball down, and split and shape into a loaf. Let rise for
                another 30 minutes or so.
            - >
                In the meantime, start preheating the oven to 350 degrees F.
            - >
                Place the pans in the oven, bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the tops
                are lightly golden and sound hollow when tapped.
        Time:
