title: "Banana Bread (yeast leavened)"
recipe:
    - Banana Bread:
        Primary: Yes
        Ingredients:
            - Mashed bananas:
                Amount: 2C
                Note: As with most banana bread recipes, I use overripe bananas
            - Hard white spring wheat flour, whole grain:
                Amount: 480g
            - Active dry yeast:
                Amount: 2t
                Note: In most recipes I mix this with water to active. I just throw it in the dough in this one.
            - Sorghum Syrup:
                Amount: 100g
                Note: Most recipies will use brown sugar, I use this instead. You could substitute 80g brown sugar and 20g water.
            - Salt:
                Amount: 8g
            - Melted butter:
                Amount: 1/4C
        Instructions:
            - >
                Add everything together and mix with a wooden spoon until it becomes difficult.
            - >
                Let the dough rise covered for roughly an hour. It may not appear to rise much due to the low
                gluten content.
            - > 
                Start preheating the oven to 350 degrees F.
            - >
                Pour the dough into a loaf pan, I use a Lodge cast iron pan for this.
            - >
                Place the pan in the oven, bake for 30-45 minutes, or until percieved as baked. It takes longer in
                a cold cast iron than it would in an aluminum loaf pan.
        Time:
            - Active: 15m
            - Inactive: 2h

I wanted to make banana bread that was yeast leavened and less cakey than the traditional recipe. What came out was exactly what I was looking for.
This recipe is not as sweet as traditional banana bread, and has a subtler banana flabor, but is still obviously banana bread and just as good to
snack on.
