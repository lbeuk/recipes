title: "Hamburger Buns"
recipe:
    - Hamburger Buns:
        Primary: Yes
        Ingredients:
            - Hard white spring wheat flour, whole grain:
                Amount: 450g
            - Plain potato flakes/flour:
                Amount: 50g
            - Water and egg:
                Amount: 400g
                Note: Use 1 egg, and fill with water until the combined mass of the water and egg is 400g.
            - Active dry yeast:
                Amount: 2t
                Note: In most recipes I mix this with water to active. I just throw it in the dough in this one.
            - Sugar:
                Amount: 1T
            - Salt:
                Amount: 8g
        Instructions:
            - >
                Add everything together and mix with a wooden spoon until it becomes difficult, then knead by hand for 5 minutes.
            - >
                Let the dough rise covered for roughly an hour. It may not appear to rise much due to the low
                gluten content.
            - > 
                Start preheating the oven to 400 degrees F.
            - >
                Split the dough into roughly 9 equal segments, form buns, and squish down on a parchment lined baking sheet slightly to make wider.
            - >
                Place the sheet in the oven, bake for 15-20 minutes, or until it is just beginning to brown.
        Time:
            - Active: 15m
            - Inactive: 2h
