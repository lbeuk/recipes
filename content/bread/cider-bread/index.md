title: "Cider Bread"
recipe:
    - Autolyse Mix:
        Ingredients:
            - Hard white spring wheat flour, whole grain:
                Amount: 250g
            - Einkorn wheat flour, whole grain:
                Amount: 250g
            - Hard Cider:
                Amount: 360g
                Note: 1 can of cider, I use Tablott's Scrappy Apple.
        Instructions:
            - Mix flour and cider with hand until combined.
            - Let sit for 30 minutes.
        Time:
            - Active: 5m
            - Inactive: 30m
    - Honey Wheat Bread:
        Primary: Yes
        Ingredients:
            - Autolyse mix:
                CREF: Autolyse Mix
                Amount: All
            - Active dry yeast:
                Amount: 2T
                Note: In most recipes I mix this with water to active. I just throw it in the dough in this one.
            - Kosher salt:
                Amount: 8g
            - Sorghum Syrup:
                Amount: 2T
                Note: You could probably use honey or molasses instead. I use Muddy Pond Sorghum.
        Instructions:
            - >
                Add everything to the autolyse mix.
            - >
                Knead the mix. The Einkorn doesn't have much gluten, so there won't be much gluten
                development. I just knead for roughly 5 minutes.
            - >
                Pour the combined oil, honey, salt, and yeast sponge into the autolyse.
            - >
                Let the dough rise covered for roughly an hour.
            - >
                Gently punch the dough ball down, place into a loaf pan, and let rise for another ~30 minutes.
                I like to use my Lodge cast iron loaf pan for this recipe, I think it gives a better crust for
                a more hearty bread than my sandwhich loafs.
            - >
                In the meantime, start preheating the oven to 350 degrees F.
            - >
                Place the pan in the oven, bake for 30-45 minutes, or until percieved as baked. It takes longer in
                a cold cast iron than it would in an aluminum loaf pan.
        Time:
            - Active: 10m
            - Inactive: 2h

I made this recipe on an impulse after wondering how bread would taste if I used hard cider in place of water. I find it
to be a good, heartier loaf, thanks largely in part to the einkorn wheat flour. It has a slight cider flavor, but is not
overwhelmingly so, and it is definitely not a sweet bread.
