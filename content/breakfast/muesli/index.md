Muesli is somewhat like an uncooked granola without added sugar. It simply consists of whole grains, nuts and seeds, and dried fruit. I like to eat it the "swiss style", which includes mixing the muesli mix with yogurt and a grated apple, and letting it soak overnight in the fridge.

The recipe is very flexible, and can be scaled up or down. I usually make my batches using a mass unit of 100g, which makes me a bit over a gallon freezer bag of muesli.

Other ingredients can be easily added to this mix as well, such as slivered almonds, coconut, flax, wheat bran, amaranth, buckwheat, kumut, etc. The dried fruits add sweetness, so find what your desired fruit to grain/nut ratio is, and you can customize the ingredients from there.

All ingredients that I have listed were easily found at Natural Grocers in the bulk section.
