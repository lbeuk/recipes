      <title>Banana Bread (yeast leavened)</title>

      <description>I wanted to make banana bread that was yeast leavened and less cakey than the traditional recipe. What came out was exactly what I was looking for. This recipe is not as sweet as traditional banana bread, and has a subtler banana flabor, but is still obviously banana bread and just as good to snack on.</description>

      <description>I made this recipe on an impulse after wondering how bread would taste if I used hard cider in place of water. I find it to be a good, heartier loaf, thanks largely in part to the einkorn wheat flour. It has a slight cider flavor, but is not overwhelmingly so, and it is definitely not a sweet bread.</description>

      <title>Honey Wheat Bread</title>

      <description>This is the sandwhich loaf I was raised on, and is the primary recipe I continue to use for day-to-day bread consumption. The bread comes out tender and light, slightly sweet from the honey, and without the bitter taste that often comes from whole whea bread thanks to using hard white wheat, rather than hard red wheat (which is often the base for commercial bread flours).&#xA;The recipe usually yields enough dough for 3 loaves of roughly 3lb 10oz (loaf size will vary depending on the pan you use to bake in), plus a little extra that I will use to make snack-sized buns in a muffin pan.</description>
